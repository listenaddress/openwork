## Openwork 
Welcome. We're building a public space to organize, share, and collaborate on any project. Somewhere to see what others are working on and the projects they contribute to, and then be able to jump in and collaborate instantly.

Here's a simple prototype I made in keynote: https://github.com/thomasbeta/openwork/blob/master/Openwork.pdf

This app is using [MEAN.JS Official Yeoman Generator](http://meanjs.org/). S/o to that project.
